Coffee Machine

This Python program simulates a simple coffee machine that allows users to order different types of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) and makes sure it has sufficient resources to fulfill the order.
**************************************************
How to Use:

1. Start the machine: The program will display a menu of available coffee options.

2. Place an order: Select the desired coffee: "espresso", "latte", or "cappuccino".

3. Insert coins: If the machine has sufficient resources, it will prompt you to insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).

4. Check payment: The program will calculate the total amount inserted and check if it's enough to cover the cost of the coffee.

5. Receive coffee/refund:
   
      If the payment is sufficient, the machine will dispense the coffee and any change.
   
      If the payment is insufficient, the inserted coins will be refunded.
   
6. Check resources (optional): Enter "report" to view the current levels of water, milk, coffee, and the total profit.

7. Turn off the machine: Enter "off" to stop the program.
